# Natural Language Processing Project
Group project for the NLP subject in our AI degree.

## Files in this repository
- `data`: contains the training and test data, as well as preprocessed data useful for our models.
- `src`: contains all the python scripts and jupyter notebooks.
	- `blindNegex.py`: code for the Full Scope NegEx, the baseline model.
	- `preprocesing.py`: functions for data preprocessing, incuding tokenization and lemmatization.
	- `negex.py`: implementation of NegEx as proposed in the original paper, using medical terms extracted from the training set.
	- `eval.py`: code to evaluate the model predictions
	- `.ipynb` files: python scripts used during the development of this project, to test and demonstrate the funcitonality of their corresponding `.py` files.
